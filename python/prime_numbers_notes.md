# observations

the differences between all prime numbers is an even number, with the exceptions of 2 and 3, with a difference of 1.

2 and 3 can be hardcoded in this case. From then on we can skip every other number. We rule out half of the numbers right away from this fact.

There are no consistant differences mathematically between prime numbers, besides that all that i can see are ODD numbers.

i'll probably make my own at some point. primality checking is slow, unless i can somehow speed that up
